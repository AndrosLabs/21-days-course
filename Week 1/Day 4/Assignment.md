# Day 4 Assignment 

You have learnt a lot of commands but again for the most time you might have been craming them and not applying them as a part of your programming habit.

Let's test your knowledge and take your knowledge out for a spin:

- Share your GitHub Profile ID
- Sign up for GitHub Student Developer account
- Create a Public Repo and share something non technical or technical
Maybe that Quote you read from your favourite, your artwork or a vocabulary word, your favourite Song or anything that touches you (Don't worry, we will delete it afterwards).

- Share this Repo with me.
